## Who are we ?
Autodrop aims to be a self-contained shipping solution for cooperations and individials alike.

We wish to provide full ecosystem for autonomous vehicles/drones which can deliver

cargo from your warehouses (or doorsteps) to anywhere in the world ASAP

## How the magic happens :

Autodrop uses state of the art algorithims to find the shortest routes from just a picture of a map and ensures high-speed delivery of goods with the lowest carbon footprint possible.

In addition, we also outfit our drones with our in-house self-driving technologies to detect obstacles and weather to deliver your package to you safely .
 
 ## Work example:
 
 ### 1) Path finding Algorithims :
 
 __To find a shortest route , we have utilized heuristic search algorithims. Namely :__
 
a. Greedy Best First Search

b. Beam search

c. A* Search

Our project takes bmp image files as input map data then applies the above algorithims ðŸ¤–
It then outputs the route according to the selected algorithim in an image file, and also provides a .csv file comparing the various algorithims
