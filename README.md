## Who are we ?
Autodrop aims to be a self-contained shipping solution for cooperations and individials alike.

We wish to provide full ecosystem for autonomous vehicles/drones which can deliver cargo from your warehouses (or doorsteps) to anywhere in the world ASAP

## How the magic happens :

Autodrop uses state of the art algorithims to find the shortest routes between a pair of senders and recievers and ensures high-speed delivery of goods with the lowest carbon footprint possible.

In addition, we also outfit our drones with our in-house self-driving technologies to detect obstacles and weather to deliver your package to you safely .


 ## Work example:
 
 ### Path finding Algorithims :
 
 __To find a shortest route , for now we have utilized the following algorithms:__
 
a. Breadth First Search

b. Dijkstra Search

c. A* Search


 
 1. Loading local (Near Saint Petersruurg Polytechnical university) intersections in the map: ![](/img/Intersections.png)
 
 1. Route between two location: ![](/img/route.png)
 
 1. Breadth First Search (BFS) Result for the above mentioned route:
    Total nodes visit to find the shortest rout: ![](/img/bfs_route_number.png)
   
    BFS search visiualization: ![](/img/bfs_visualization.png)
   
 1. Dijkstra Result for the above mentioned route:
   Total nodes visit to find the shortest rout: ![](/img/dijkstra _route_number.png)
   
   Dijkstra visiualization: ![](/img/dijkstra_visualization.png)
   
 1. A* Search (BFS) Result for the above mentioned route:
   Total nodes visit to find the shortest rout: ![](/img/astart_route_number.png)
   
   A* search visiualization: ![](/img/astarvisualization.png)
